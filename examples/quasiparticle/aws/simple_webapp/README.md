# What does this example do?
- The purpose of this example is to show one of multiple ways to use Particle Cloud Framework (PCF) to deploy cloud infrastructure which in this case is using a Flask api. In this particular example we deploy the ec2-route53 quasiparticle which creates a route53 record and adds the desired number on ec2 instances to the record set. To use in your environment, simply change some of the configurations parameters in the quasiparticle definition.
